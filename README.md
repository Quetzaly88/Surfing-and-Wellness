# Surfing-and-Wellness
Project 1 Code Institute

Surfing and wellness is a site to inspire users to do a different sport which can help them connect with themselves and nature. This website is targeted to people in need of new perspectives in life and with the desire to find a new support community. 
Users of this website can find information about our work and they can even complete an application to be part of these journeys.


Responsive Mockup


Features
Navigation Bar
* Featured on all three pages. You can go over the different parts of the website. Home will direct you to the main page. Gallery will direct you to the pictures of travels with Surfing Wellness. At the end we have the Application where people can write some information about themselves and be candidates to be part of the Surf and Wellness adventures. 

* The same navigation bar is avaiable on all three pages to make it possible return to de desired page.

* The navigation has also the logotype of "Surfing and Wellnes" which has a good contrast with the other colors of the page.

The gallery page

The user can see the adventures that we had with other groups an have apreciation of our work. 


Features Left to Implement
Add teachers and staff pictures on the site, with information about them and their experience. 
Add images that are already with the right size and with .webp to save time. The images has also to have a name without spaves otherwise W3 validator shows a misstake. 


Testing
Home, Gallery and Application work perfectly in all devices. You can return and go to all the pages from all the pages. 
The footer has the advantage to redirect the users to google maps, all social media avaiable and even email draft. 

The site is avaiable in on all devices bigger than  414px x 736px. 

An interesting mistake found on W3 code tester is the "meta" 
Attribute description" not allowed on element meta at this point. W3 validator

Some problems that I found are:
- Adjusting the footer to all devices.
- Reduce video prev. size
- Some css styling as flex-box


Validator Testing
HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator


CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
From the "Code and automation" source select "pages"
On Github Pages find "Source", choose "deploy from a branch".
On branch you will find two dop-down menus. Choose "main", "root" and push the "save button".
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
