# Surfing-and-Wellness
Project 1 Code Institute

Surfing and wellness is a site to inspire users to do a different sport which can help them connect with themselves and nature. This website is targeted to people in need of new perspectives in life and with the desire to find a new support community. 
Users of this website can find information about our work and they can even complete an application to be part of these journeys.

User Experience (UX)

Design

Colour Scheme

I chose warm tones for my website in order to communicate peace and relaxation. 
I used coolors.co sto be able to match correctly all the tones. The dark color was used on header and footer. The ligter colors were used as background colors with gradienst property.

Typography

The chosen typography was adquired from fonts google.
I chose "Manrope" for the main text because is a redable font and adapts easy to all the context.
Another font is "Rowdies". This one was chosen for all the header and footer elements because is more fun and interactive.

Google Fonts is a popular choice for importing fonts to use in your project, as it doesn't require you to download the fonts to use them.

Imagery
Use this section to explain what sort of imagery you plan to use through your site.

Wireframes
Add the images or links for your wireframes here.

There are lots of different options to create your wireframes - Code Institute students can access Balsamiq as part of the course.

Some other options include Figma, AdobeXD, Sketch and Mockup to name just a few! Or you can even go old school and get those wireframes completed using pen and paper. Just snap an image of the completed wireframes to add the images to the README.










FEATURES

![](assets/README.files/main-.webp)

Navigation Bar:

* Featured on all three pages. You can go over the different parts of the website. Home will direct you to the main page. Gallery will direct you to the pictures of travels with Surfing Wellness. At the end we have the Application where people can write some information about themselves and be candidates to be part of the Surf and Wellness adventures. 

* The same navigation bar is avaiable on all three pages to make it possible return to de desired page.

* The navigation has also the logotype of "Surfing and Wellnes" which has a good contrast with the other colors of the page. 


The landing page image:
The landing page includes the Title and a photograph with text overlay. This allows the user understand about the mental and physical benefits of surfing and why is this important. The image gives the user an idea of what is happiness when you are having fun and challenging yourself. 


The main section
Here we have the main content that shows some of the most important activities included in this program. The programs are based on rehabilitate and make people feel better. Everyone can be part of this journey no matter how old or what background you have. 
Surf, surfskate, yoga and meditation are some of the activities that individuals can enjoy during this journey.

Inside the main content we have an embeded video which is a trailer for a documental. The video is very moving and shows how has veterans return to their normal lives thanks to surfing. This is proof that this program can be very beneficial.

Application Form

*In this page, the users provide basic information about themselves. Name, last name, email adress and some questions. 
    The questions are important for the team to know a little bit more about the users and their experience in the water. 
*S&W team can locate people in the most adaptable group. Then, they can contact the users about what is avaiable. 


![](assets/README.files/application.webp)

Footer

*The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for S&W which can keep our users connected. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. 
* We provide our contact information, adress, phone numbers and direct conection to e-mail and google maps. 


Features Left to Implement
Add teachers and staff pictures on the site, with information about them and their experience. 
Add images that are already with the right size and with .webp to save time. The images has also to have a name without spaves otherwise W3 validator shows a misstake. 


Testing
*Home, Gallery and Application are responsive. 

*The footer redirect the users to google maps, all social media avaiable and even email draft. 

*The site is avaiable in on all devices (max-width 1200px)

Bugs

I've been correcting and adjusting small mistakes in all the process of this project. 
Sometimes I've made big changes to make the page look better. 

Some problems that I found are:
- Adjusting the footer to all devices.
- Reduce video prev. size
- Some css styling as flex-box.


Validator Testing
HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator


CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator


Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
From the "Code and automation" source select "pages"
On Github Pages find "Source", choose "deploy from a branch".
On branch you will find two dop-down menus. Choose "main", "root" and push the "save button".
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

Design

Colour Scheme
Add all information about your colour scheme for your site here. You can explain why you choose the colours you did?

I like to include a palette of the colour scheme here, my favourite site for creating a colour palette is coolors, but there are lots of other sites that also do the same thing, like ColorSpace, Muzli Colors, Adobe Colour Wheel and Canva to name a few.

Typography
If you've imported fonts to use in your project, add some information about them here. You can include information like:

Why did you choose the font you have? Is this an accessibly friendly font? What weights have you included?

I also like to include an image of the fonts chosen as a reference.

Google Fonts is a popular choice for importing fonts to use in your project, as it doesn't require you to download the fonts to use them.

Imagery
Use this section to explain what sort of imagery you plan to use through your site.

Wireframes
Add the images or links for your wireframes here.

Features
üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section here

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

General features on each page
If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use amiresponsive which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

Future Implementations
What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

Accessibility
Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these? Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements? Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

Technologies Used
üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Technologies Used section here

Languages Used
Make a note here of all the languages used in creating your project. For the first project this will most likely just be HTML & CSS.

Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

Deployment & Local Development
üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Deployment & Local Development section here

Deployment
Include instructions here on how to deploy your project. For your first project you will most likely be using GitHub Pages.

Local Development
The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

How to Fork
Place instructions on how to fork your project here.

How to Clone
Place instructions on how to clone your project here.

Testing
Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.

Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file here

Credits
üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Credits section here

The Credits section is where you can credit all the people and sources you used throughout your project.

Code Used
If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

Content
Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.

 Media
If you have used any media on your site (images, audio, video etc) you can credit them here. I like to link back to the source where I found the media, and include where on the site the image is used.

 Acknowledgments
If someone helped you out during your project, you can acknowledge them here! For example someone may have taken the time to help you on slack with a problem. Pop a little thank you here with a note of what they helped you with (I like to try and link back to their GitHub or Linked In account too). This is also a great place to thank your mentor and tutor support if you used them.
