# Surfing-and-Wellness
Project 1 Code Institute

Surfing and wellness is a site to inspire users to do a different sport which can help them connect with themselves and nature. This website is targeted to people in need of new perspectives in life and with the desire to find a new support community. 
Users of this website can find information about our work and they can even complete an application to be part of these journeys.

Features Left to Implement
Add teachers and staff pictures on the site, with information about them and their experience. 
Add images that are already with the right size and with .webp to save time. The images has also to have a name without spaves otherwise W3 validator shows a misstake.

*The footer redirect the users to google maps, all social media avaiable and even email draft. 

*The site is avaiable in on all devices (max-width 1200px)

Bugs

I've been correcting and adjusting small mistakes in all the process of this project. 
Sometimes I've made big changes to make the page look better. 

Some problems that I found are:
- Adjusting the footer to all devices.
- Reduce video prev. size
- Some css styling as flex-box.


Validator Testing
HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator


CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
From the "Code and automation" source select "pages"
On Github Pages find "Source", choose "deploy from a branch".
On branch you will find two dop-down menus. Choose "main", "root" and push the "save button".
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
